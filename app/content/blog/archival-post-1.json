This also helps me work on information retention and allows me to give back to the community that has shown me the awesome world of cybersecurity, pentesting, homelabbing, and systems administration. \n\nI want to start out by chipping away at my project backlog. I've started a number of things that I want to swing back around and finish up. So far up on the docket:\n\n- - -\n\n### Homebrew Rubber Ducky\n\nI'm a big fan of [The Cyber Mentor](https://twitter.com/thecybermentor?s=21) and he posted this video about a $2 [Rubber Ducky](https://shop.hak5.org/collections/hotplug-attack-tools/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe) alternative. A super easy fun little project.\n\n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uH-4btjE56E\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n### Docker Compose\n\nSomething that I've been putting off that I have to take care of is converting my docker stack to [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). \n\nSwitching my run files to compose would allow more manageable file structures, something easier to backup and maintain.\n\n### Try Hack Me - Pentest+ Pathway\n\nI want to continue along the [Pentest+ Learning Pathway on Try Hack Me](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/pentestplus) and further my ethical hacking skills. This platform provides a great hands on way of learning. I look forward to familiarizing myself with this material and getting the certification.\n\n### Reverse Proxy\n\nI would love to get reverse proxy set up for my home services. It's getting annoying having to go IP's, would be so much easier with DNS names. It would also make it easier to share in the house.\n\nMaybe I'm just dense, but I couldn't get Caddy working on my first time, I don't know why.\n\nBut this is gonna be revisited with NGINX next time.\n\n### VLAN - Seperating IoT\n\nI have an Edgerouter 4, a UniFi PoE 24 port switch, and a UniFi AP AC Pro.\n\nI have several IoT devices that I'm getting more distrustful of.\n\nTo remedy that I want to segregate my network with VLANs, but while keeping functionality. That means putting the IoT device on their VLAN but allowing them to receive multicast packets from the trusted VLAN. \n\nShould be fun to tackle.\n\n- - -\n\n#### That's what I have to work on so far!\n\n***Stay Curious***",
